In 2009,  a group of friends established Writers Central to reduce the costs associated with publishing books. At the time it was very expensive to produce professional copies with high-quality binding on premium paper stock. It was even more difficult to get the books out there for the public to read. A mash-up of print-on-demand technology coupled with a self-publishing platform democratised the entire process. Over the years, Writers Central has grown to support a thriving community of free-lance authors, experienced and well-known novelists and budding writers. }
